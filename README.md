# BorroWoof
BorroWoof is a web app that allows people to borrow someone's dog. Have a dog but not the full responsibilities of having one.

##Inspiration:
Who doesn't like dogs? Dogs keep you active, improve social life, reduce stress, reduce depression and so much more. We wanted to design an app to allow people who don't want the full responsibility of having a dog to be able to 'borrow' a dog. If someone wants to adopt a dog but has never had one, it allows that person to have a brief experience. This will keep heartache from happening. Not the person nor dog wants to go back to the shelter. A person can be going through a hard time and having a dog just for the weekend can help. There are unlimited possibilities for borrowing a dog but the outcome will always be positive. 
##Overview:
Register - A person who wants to join the BorroWoof community will start here. They will register and fill out the information and upload a photo. It will then direct them to their USER page. From there if they have a dog they want to be lent out. They register their dog from the page under 'Have A Dog'. 
Login- A person who has an account will login here and it will take them to their page. If they have a dog they lend out, their dog profile will be shown as well. It will also show a borrowing history of the dogs the person borrowed. 
Search Dogs: From here, someone can see all the available dogs to be borrowed. In the future we would like to be able to add filters for zipcode, breed, age, activity level, and others.
